# chatbot
A Flask chatbot application, designed with small newsrooms in mind, that uses the OpenAI API to answer user questions drawing upon information contained in a provided knowledge base of news articles.

The code created as part of this project can be broadly classified into two parts, the scripts that prepare article data for use in the chatbot (contained within the prepScripts directory), and the Flask project files for that chatbot tool itself (contained within the chatbotTool directory). 

# Implementation Details

To implement this chatbot requires a few things:
* Python 3.8+ downloaded to your local computer
* The files for the preperation scripts and the flask application files, as found in this repository
* An OpenAI account and an API key
* An FTP client
